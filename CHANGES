Changed "Parsecs" to "Steps"

Fixed display of negative temperatures

Added Yahoo Weather and allowed it to work without an API key

Fixed crash when switching away from watchface or changing watchfaces

Fixed failure time display to show 2 digits, so 7:05am can be distinguished

"7:05" for am, and "19:05" for pm.
